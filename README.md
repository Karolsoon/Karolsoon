- 👋 Hi, I’m @Karolsoon
- 👀 I’m interested in a BIG life change from Quality Assurance to Python programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with Flask, Pytest, GIT, SQL basics (SQLAlchemy on SQLite), TDD, HTML/CSS...later js, Docker
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing particular, just learning.
- 📫 How to reach me ...in the future, starting from 02.2022.
